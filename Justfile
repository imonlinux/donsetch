# DonSeTch dev loop — one profile, everything fast.
#
# Everything below runs on the `ci` cargo profile (release opts,
# no fat LTO): test links take seconds, the binary behaves like
# release (`panic = "abort"` inherited), and all artifacts share
# one graph in target/ci. Fat LTO runs once, at ship time, via a
# plain `cargo build --release` (see status.md Workflow section).
#
#   just check    compile-check the full feature set (~10s warm)
#   just test     full test suite, full features, fail-fast
#   just lint     clippy -Dwarnings on the full feature set
#   just all      the pre-push gate: fmt + lint + test
#   just bin      build target/ci/donsetch (for live smokes)
#   just smoke    bin + doctor + fetch/search/bypass smoke
#   just fuzz extract    30s fuzz burst on one target

# Pre-push gate: everything CI will flag.
all: fmt-check lint test

# Pre-tag gate: `all` + the Cargo.lock gate (catches a version bump
# with a stale lock in seconds, the failure that used to cost a full
# release round-trip) + the tag-time payload gates mirrored against
# the ci-profile binary. Fat LTO is NOT built locally: the release
# workflow's own gates are the authoritative payload check, paying
# for the fat-LTO build twice bought nothing.
preflight: all lockgate ci-gates

# Full fat-LTO + gates, for when the release workflow itself changed
# and the payload gates must be proven locally first.
